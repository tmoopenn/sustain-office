      Scenario: Submiting a Summary for an event
          Given I am signed in with provider Google
          Given I am on the home page
          When I follow "Class 1"
          Then I follow "Register for this Event"
          Then I should see "You are now registered for the event Class 1"
          When I click on my name
          Then I should see my profile
          When I follow "Submit Event Summary"
          Then I should see "Add an Event Summary for Class 1"
          When I fill in "Summary" with "whats up"
          And I press "Submit this summary"
          Then I should see my profile
          And I should see "Summary created for 'Class 1'"
